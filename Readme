#DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF 5KW MODULAR GRID CONNECTED CONVERTER
The primary objective of this project is to develop and implement a state-of-the-art
5KW modular grid-connected converter with the goal of revolutionizing energy conver-
sion systems for increased adaptability and efficiency. In a grid-connected environment,
the converter’s function is to control source power, making it compatible with a range
of load requirements. The converter’s modular design offers a scalable and adaptable
method that enables easy integration into a range of power systems. Because of its
versatility and 5KW capacity, it can be used in both residential and commercial envi-
ronments. The focus on modularity makes it simple to expand or reconfigure to meet
changing energy requirements.
This project report addresses the imperative control objectives of a three-phase
(3Phase) active front end (AFE) converter, aiming to achieve enhanced performance
in line with IEEE standards. The identified control objectives include maintaining a
low value for line current Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) at the AC side (THDi less
than or equal to 5 Percentage), ensuring in-phase operation of AC side voltages and
currents, and achieving superior regulation of the DC link voltage.
In energy processing, pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques are essential for
producing accurate gate signals for power semiconductor devices. This guarantees the
best possible power conversion efficiency and performance. This project pushes the
limits of innovation in energy conversion technology by building upon a wealth of
research in semiconductor devices, converter topologies, PWM techniques, and con-
trollers. With its ability to handle the dynamic challenges of modern power systems
and its contribution to the ongoing evolution of smart grids and renewable energy in-
tegration, the 5KW modular grid-connected converter is a significant milestone in the
search for sustainable and flexible energy solutions
